#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello! I’m a final-year master’s student in Computational Linguistics (NLP) at the University of Washington, advised by Yejin Choi and Tim Althoff. My research focuses on the intersection of NLP and human. Broadly, I’m intrigued by how humans understand and think during decision-making, and how technology can help improve those decisions. My goal is to build and enhance empathetic, moral, and culturally sensitive AI, with a current focus on novel data collection methods from humans for model evaluation and alignment.
